# LUHShibAuth

This plugin parses the matriculate number from WebSSO for the Leibniz University Hanover, it also sets the login {USERNAME} as the LUH-ID instead of the default ILIAS Shibboleth login prefix: {firstname.lastname}

## Installation

In your {ILIAS Root} directory
```bash
mkdir -p Customizing/global/plugins/Services/AuthShibboleth/ShibbolethAuthenticationHook
cd Customizing/global/plugins/Services/AuthShibboleth/ShibbolethAuthenticationHook
git clone https://github.com/iFadi/LUHShibAuth.git
```

Now check a specific Tag:
```bash
git checkout v1.0.3
```
Goto "Administration -> Plugin" and install and activate the plugin.

Goto "Administration -> Authentication -> Shibboleth and configure user profile mapping "Attribut fÃ¼r Matrikelnummer => schacPersonalUniqueCode"

Choose "Update this field on login" if the matricalation field should modified on every login request.

## Tips
Debug messages are triggered with "component log level" DEBUG in "Administration -> Logging

If you do not see the plugin under "Administration" > "Plugins", in your {ILIAS Root} you should run:
```bash
composer install --no-dev
```
to check if there are errors.
